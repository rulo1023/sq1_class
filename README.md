# Simple Square-1 class, used to process Square-1 sessions
This class has been made with the objetive to apply simple statistics to the obtained data, e.g Get frequencies of CubeShapes based on a session's sample, etc

It's as simple as it gets, it's not an optimal solver, just a thing that tells you what CubeShape it is.
